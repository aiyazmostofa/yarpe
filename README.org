* YARPE
Yet Another Reverse Polish Emulator

[[screenshot.png]]

** Description
YARPE is an assembly program (written in C) for the TI-84 Plus CE that emulates the Reverse Polish Notation interfaces found on some Hewlett Packard calculators.
YARPE is specifically designed to tackle the numerical input questions found on the UIL Calculator Applications contest.
YARPE doesn't have support for symbolic expressions or complex numbers.
YARPE supports arithmetic, trigonometric, and logarithmic operations.
YARPE supports a 100 level stack.

** Installation
This is an assembly program, so:
- If your calculator version is >= 5.5, you will need to do somethings before you can run the program.
  Here is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abB0ZEdQ1rs][video]] that shows the process.
- If your calculator version is <= 5.4, you can just send the program using TI Connect CE like you would normally.

You will also need to install this. [[https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest][clibs.8xg]]

*** Primary Functions
These are functions that require no shift (second) key to be pressed first.

| Function            | Keys           |
|---------------------+----------------|
| Push                | =enter=        |
| Add                 | =+=            |
| Subtract            | =-= (Subtract) |
| Negate              | =-= (Negate)   |
| Multiply            | =×=            |
| Divide              | =÷=            |
| Exponent            | =^=            |
| Backspace           | =)= or =del=   |
| Clear Input         | =clear=        |
| Square              | =x^2=          |
| Log Base 10         | =log=          |
| Natural Log         | =ln=           |
| Sin                 | =sin=          |
| Cos                 | =cos=          |
| Tan                 | =tan=          |
| Decimal             | =.=            |
| Radians / Degree    | =apps=         |
| Scientific / Normal | =mode=         |
| Reciprocal          | =x^-1=         |
| EE (Read Below)     | =comma=     |

For the EE function, say you want to type =3.65×10^4=, here are the buttons you want to press:
=3= =.= =6= =5= =enter= =4= =comma=

*** Secondary Functions
These functions can be accessed when the second mode is activated (just like in the normal TI interface).
To activate the second mode, you can of course press the =2nd= key.
But you can also press the =(=, which is a lot easier to reach.

| Function     | Keys          |
|--------------+---------------|
| Undo         | =enter=       |
| Exit         | =)= or =mode= |
| e (constant) | =÷=           |
| π (constant) | =^=           |
| Arcsin       | =sin=         |
| Arccos       | =cos=         |
| Arctan       | =tan=         |
| Square Root  | =x^2=         |
| 10^          | =log=         |
| e^           | =ln=          |

*** Color Themes
Color Themes can be set by pressing =alpha= then =window= and then you can scroll through the themes
using the =up= key. To set the selected theme, press =enter=.

| Color Theme  |
|--------------+
| Default      |
| Monkeytype   |
| Dracula      |
| Gruvbox      |

** Build
Install the toolchain using this link [[https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/static/getting-started.html][here]]. 
Follow the instructions from the same link for building the hello world project but replace the example project with this repository.

** Credits
- [[https://github.com/arjvik/RPN-Ti84][RPN-Ti84]]: 
I used this project to learn a lot of my reverse polish notation.
I implemented a lot of the same functionality and features from this program into YARPE.

- [[https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain][CE C/C++ Toolchain]]:
This made developing for the TI-84 Plus CE a very nice experience.
I got the speed of an assembly program while programming in a high level language like C.
The documentation is also great.
